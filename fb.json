We now have to have horrible conversations about which one of us can live without healthcare. The very minimum plan for my family of 3 is $1700 and it is the worst possible plan that you can get and still have health insurance. It pays for nothing. The deductible is $14,000 for our family. We don't qualify for subsidies. Last year we thought our insurance was expensive but we kept sticking by the idea that it would get fixed. We have been loyal Democrats this whole time. Now? You are not doing ANYTHING for ANYONE. Stop sending me emails asking me for money, also. Democrats are busy eating their own 4 days before elections and now we are going to have to live with whatever dystopian nightmare comes next because you people literally cannot get it together.",

We make a nice living, but we\u2019re not wealthy, certainly not by Northern Virginia standards.  When the ACA was enacted it was a godsend.  Our premiums for our family of 5 (all of us have preexisting conditions) were manageable.  We qualified for no subsidy, and it was expensive but it was do-able.  This year we had the best policy we\u2019d had since being self-employed.  $1600 monthly premium, but we could swing it.  For 2018, that policy isn\u2019t offered.  Most similar policy has a $3200 per month premium.  What are we supposed to do? As a practice of two with no employees, we don\u2019t qualify for group insurance.  My eldest son has a seizure disorder, I have severe asthma.  My youngest has kidney issues.  But we simply cannot afford $36,000 annually for medical insurance.  Trump and his people have put my family in a horrendous, dangerous position.  What are we supposed to do?",
